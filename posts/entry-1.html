<h2 id="about-the-static-site-generator">About the static site generator</h2>
<p>I was thinking about things I should be doing during the day (besides work, of course). In between waiting for deployments, testing stuff and such, fixing some things in the ssg and blog in general.</p>
<p>These were the things I had in mind that I should do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making my template responsive</li>
</ol>
<p>For some dumbass reason my first version had no meta tag with the viewport and I took wait to long to realize it.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Generating posts in a <code>/posts</code> folder</li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted the resource path to be like .../posts/my-post.html. I did that but god it was such a pain for some reason. Everything stopped working once I did that. But it's working already.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Setting up an env file</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything was hardcoded into the main program, I updated it to use environment variables in an .env file so it would be easier if anyone else wanted to use the generator.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Adding categories to posts</li>
</ol>
<p>This was a suggestion from X actually. I only added the categories, didn't bother to create a page for them at this moment because I am simply too lazy to do it I guess.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>I've been feeling a little lost for a while. Not only career wise but in general. I have my future pretty well structured in my mind, what I intend on doing, how I want to do it. But I just don't feel too... sure on everything.</p>
<p>I feel like I have no sense of personal style, sometimes that I even lack personality. All I do apart from working and working out is coding. I haven't played any games lately, maybe I should by one? But nothing particularly interesting has been released... for Nintendo Switch at least.</p>
<p>This feels awkward.</p>

<p>I watched Wicked a couple weeks ago and since then I couldn't stop thinking about it. It was such a good movie and a good way of getting out the musical to more people. Watching plays, musicals isn't cheap here so having the opportunity to experience that in the movie was fantastic. Also, it's a little insane how everything was recorded live, how both Cynthia and Ariana did their own stunts. Like, Elphaba is floating around in a broom while SINGING THAT. Also, from what I've seen, they refrained from using lots of CGI so Chiz is a complete set. I feel like such artistry has so much value.</p>
