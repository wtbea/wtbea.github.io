<p>I haven't been in a good mood these past few days. My self-esteem isn't at an all time high... let's put it like that. I was feeling like I should likely refactor the SSG but... at the same time I don't really feel like it anymore. Maybe I should have done it in a good way from the start but... I didn't. As it turns out now I don't really want to do the same thing - but all over again.</p>
<p>My hand hurts so most of my thoughts will be audio today.</p>
