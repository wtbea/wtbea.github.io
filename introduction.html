<p>I am not the best author out there and although I was pretty sure I'd just make something like public notes, I feel way to inclined to write actual articles, things, diary entries of some sort? Sometimes I feel like if I died I'd have left nothing behind. It's not a good feeling, you know. A true waste of oxygen and other useful resources here on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>I believe I should introduce myself at this point, shouldn't I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Beatriz, I prefer being called Bea though. I am a 24 year old software engineer. I started coding when I was 9 to 10 years old. It was not super-mega-blaster interesting code, just some html, css and javascript. Back then I used to play a game called neopets and there we could create custom pages and such. I was a curious child with... not so many friends so obviously I was very much attracted to it. Today I learned that I lost my account because of a migration to a different kind of account. I had to open a ticket, hopefully I'll get it back.</p>
<p>Besides neopets, I also had several blogs. That's how I first came into contact with PHP, through everyone else's nightmare: wordpress. It was cool though, I enjoyed it. I remember the first few times I had to install wordpress through FTP into... less than trustworthy free servers I felt amazing, like a truly smart kid.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time on the computer and internet in general. I loved having blogs, writing and as funny as it may sound, I used to have so much fun teaching things to other people. Mostly children just like me but also some teenagers and adults as well. I am so fond of those specific memories. One of my best friends still is from those times.</p>
<p>Nostalgia feels like such a bitch though. I've been trying to recover those feelings even today. I try to live again those experiences that made me feel good at the time.</p>
<p>I try harder now though. It's never just a blog, it's something a little bit more elaborated that I made sure to learn. I had many over the years but it's hard to keep myself motivated at times.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-different-in-this-one">What is different in this one?</h2>
<p>I decided to create my own minimalist static-site-generator (SSG). I missed just having some html and css and having something ready, you know? It's not that I despise frontend frameworks or anything, it's just that I've been feeling overwhelmed by them.</p>
<p>Well, creating a SSG only because of that seems a little stupid now. But it was easy enough, though. I used Go which has been my main language for fun stuff lately. It's like 300 lines of Go code + the templates for the main page and post page. It's minimalist enough, isn't it? I intend on showing it off sometime but I feel like currently it's... messy. Maybe I will clean it up real nice and publish it as some sort of project others can use.</p>
<p>I should probably write a guide as well... shouldn't I?</p>
<p>Well, hopefully this is good enough. If I made any mistakes or sound confusing, don't let me know.</p>
